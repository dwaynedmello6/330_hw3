Support Vector Machines are sensitive to the scale of the input features, and without scaling, features with larger ranges can disproportionately influence the model. Additionally, since `SVC` requires numerical input, categorical columns need to be properly encoded.

    "1. The problem with calling `fit_transform` on your test data with `StandardScaler` is that it allows the test data to influence the scaling parameters, which violates the principle that test data should remain unseen during training. Instead, you should use the scaler trained on the training data (`fit` on training, `transform` on both train and test) to avoid data leakage and ensure unbiased performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Following the Golden Rule is crucial because it ensures that model evaluation is done on data that the model hasn't seen before, giving a true reflection of its generalization performance. Violating it could lead to overestimating the model's performance, as it may inadvertently learn from test data, leading to a classifier that appears better than it actually is in real-world use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Two advantages of using sklearn Pipelines are: (1) They streamline the process of applying multiple transformations and models in a sequence, reducing code complexity and improving readability. (2) Pipelines help prevent data leakage by ensuring that all steps (e.g., scaling, encoding) are consistently applied during cross-validation, training, and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is appropriate to use sklearn `ColumnTransformer` when you need to apply different preprocessing steps to different subsets of columns in a dataset. This is especially useful when dealing with mixed data types, such as numerical and categorical features, that require different transformations (e.g., scaling for numeric data and encoding for categorical data)."
